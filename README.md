# Dijkstra algorithm


Implementation and comparison of Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms for the needs of the course Advanced Topics Algorithms Implementation Technologies in Department of Computer Engineering & Informatics, University of Patras.<br><br>

Header file algorithms.hpp contains the following algorithms:
1. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm<br>
2. A* algorithm<br>

as well as variables for which store the vertices which have been visited by each algorithm and time consumed.

***

<b>Instructions:</b><br>
make<br>
./project<br>

(Note that LEDA and Boost libraries are essential. Please edit LEDAROOT and BOOSTROOT variables in Makefile to declare the path of the libraries. )
